        * Julien's note: if you want to change which minifier to use go to the filter function in the code
      - changed the way files are saved and loaded to account for the extra time to minify the javascript

v0.11 - added a conditional to check if WP_DEBUG is set to true

        * codex.wordpress.org/Filesystem_API
     - changed the way the paths work
        * this new method should work regardless of what the parent directory is called

v0.8 - changed the way javascript is injected to the page
